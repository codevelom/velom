The fileUpload function takes four parameters
- the form ID
- the input file ID 
- url (address to the php file which is to process the data)
- preview (optional) set to true if you want to see list of files ready for upload

Its simple and it accomplish the task.

Note: The php file included does not handle the data parsed to it. What it does is only print out all the files 
and other form data passed for clarification of files and data parsed. 

Enjoy!
